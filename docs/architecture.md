# Project Architecture

## Overview

This project provides formal verification tools for geometric patterns in fermion mass hierarchies, focusing on scale-dependent physical theories. The architecture is designed to support both theorem proving and computational verification of mathematical models related to critical gauge couplings and geometric mass patterns.

## Design Principles

### 1. Formal-Computational Bridge
The project bridges formal theorem proving with computational mathematics:
- **Lean/Coq proofs** provide rigorous mathematical foundations
- **Python models** enable numerical computation and data analysis
- **Verification scripts** ensure consistency between formal and computational approaches

### 2. Modular Architecture
Each component is designed to be independently usable:
- Theorem prover modules can be used standalone
- Mathematical models are self-contained Python modules
- Verification scripts can test individual components

### 3. Physical Relevance
All mathematical structures are grounded in physical theory:
- Standard Model fermion mass data
- Renormalization group equations
- Critical phenomena in gauge theories

## Component Interactions

### Theorem Provers ↔ Mathematical Models
- Formal definitions in Lean/Coq correspond to computational implementations
- Key theorems are validated both formally and numerically
- Physical constraints are enforced in both domains

### Verification Layer
- Automated checks ensure proof correctness
- Model validation confirms physical reasonableness
- Integration tests verify consistency across components

## Key Concepts

### Scale Dependence
Physical parameters evolve with energy scale according to renormalization group equations:
```
dg/dt = β(g)  where t = ln(μ/μ₀)
```

### Geometric Patterns
Mass hierarchies exhibit geometric relationships, particularly near critical couplings:
```
mᵢ₊₁/mᵢ ≈ φ  (golden ratio pattern)
```

### Critical Phenomena
At critical gauge coupling values, geometric patterns emerge in fermion masses through scale-dependent dynamics.

## Extension Points

The architecture supports extensions in several directions:

1. **Additional Theorem Provers**: Isabelle/HOL, Agda integration
2. **Extended Models**: Beyond Standard Model physics
3. **Advanced Verification**: Property-based testing, formal model checking
4. **Computational Tools**: Symbolic computation, machine learning analysis
